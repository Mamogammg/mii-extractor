# Mii Extractor
Mii extractor from amiibo.

It can be used to get a mii from the nintendo switch to the nintendo 3DS

A big thanks to [jozz024](https://github.com/jozz024) and their incredible [Smash Amiibo Editor](https://github.com/jozz024/smash-amiibo-editor), because it's the base for this little project.

# Running
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- All the libraries in requirements.txt

# Using
1. Download the source code
2. Run main.py
3. Import the locked-secret.bin and unfixed-info.bin. You can download these of the internet.
4. Import the dump of some amiibo. You can make a backup of amiibo using TagMo for Android, for example.

And if you want to import it to the 3ds, you can use homebrew or use Kazuki's [Mii Info Editor](https://kazuki-4ys.github.io/web_apps/MiiInfoEditorCTR/) and generate a QR Code, then scan it with the 3DS Camera.
